For some reason I cannot push to this repo, so created in gitlab where I usually create my projects.

Make sure that you are going to HTTPS on both desktop and mobile https://beatysabery.herokuapp.com/

I used chrome both on desktop and android for testing, device sensor browser APIS are only available in chrome android. This app will not work on iOS devices for now.
